My Maplesoft files and organization
Through out my Maple usage, I explored many subject areas (diciplines) and saved and wrote many worksheets that I forgot about, or cannot find.  
So, I wrote a Maple hyperlink table of contents (toc) along with other toc's at the root of many subject directory structures.  
This strategy is designed to collect the various problems, solutions, and learning, so the relearning process may be faster and more complete, **AND help limit redundant worksheets** that are coupled between many subject areas.
