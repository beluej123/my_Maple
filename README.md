My Maplesoft files and organization.  
Through out years of Maple usage, I explored many subject areas (diciplines) and saved and wrote many worksheets that I forgot about, or cannot find.  So, I wrote a Maple hyperlink table of contents (toc) along with other toc's at the root of many subject directory structures as keywords to help navigate to the 1000's of files.  This strategy is designed to collect the various problems, solutions, and learning, so the relearning process may be faster and more complete, **AND help limit redundant worksheets** that are coupled between many subject areas.  

2023, this organization effort is a work in progress.
